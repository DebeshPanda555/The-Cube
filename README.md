🎮 Cube Game – A Simple and Fun Web-Based Game

Cube Game is a lightweight, browser-based game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where players control a cube that dodges obstacles and collects points. Designed with simplicity and smooth gameplay in mind, the game is a fun way to demonstrate basic game logic, DOM manipulation, and interactive UI design.

🔧 Features:
	•	🚀 Real-time movement using keyboard controls
	•	🎯 Dynamic obstacles with increasing difficulty
	•	🎨 Minimalistic UI with clean CSS styling
	•	🔁 Replayability with a restart button and score tracking
	•	💡 Responsive and works across modern browsers

This project helped me dive deeper into event handling, animation loops, collision detection, and creating interactive experiences on the web using vanilla JavaScript.

It’s a great example of how core web technologies can be used creatively beyond static websites — blending logic with design for an engaging outcome.
